Vault Shortcut
==============

This is an extension for [SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/) that
adds a toolbar button to launch the LastPass Vault in an external browser.

Instructions
------------

1. Install the extension. You can download it from the SeaMonkey Add-ons site
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/vault-shortcut) or check the
[Releases](https://github.com/IsaacSchemm/vault-shortcut/releases) section here
on GitHub for the most recent .xpi file. After you install the extension, you
will need to restart SeaMonkey.

2. Add the "LastPass (External)" button to the toolbar. Right-click on an
empty area of a toolbar (menu bar, navigation toolbar, or bookmarks toolbar)
near the right side of the SeaMonkey window, and click Customize. Then find
the WebRTC Override icon in the list of options and drag it onto one of the
toolbars. Press Done to save your changes.

3. Configure the path to the Firefox executable in the Add-ons Manager, under
"Options" for Vault Shortcut. The path to the LastPass Vault page can be left
blank.
