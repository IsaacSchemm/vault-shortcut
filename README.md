Vault Shortcut
==============

This is an extension for [SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/) and
[Pale Moon](http://www.palemoon.org/) that adds a toolbar button to launch the
LastPass Vault in an external browser.

Instructions
------------

1. Install the extension. You can download it from the SeaMonkey Add-ons site
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/vault-shortcut) or check the
[Releases](https://github.com/IsaacSchemm/vault-shortcut/releases) section here
on GitHub for the most recent .xpi file. After you install the extension, you
will need to restart your browser.

2. Choose a browser to launch. The options for this extension can be found in
Add-ons Manager once it is installed. The default browser is Google Chrome;
other presets include Vivaldi, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. You can also
configure your own browser and URL to launch if you'd like.

3. Add the Vault button to the toolbar. Right-click on an empty area of a
toolbar (menu bar, navigation toolbar, or bookmarks toolbar) near the right
side of the SeaMonkey or Pale Moon window, and click Customize. Then find the
Vault icon in the list of options and drag it onto one of the toolbars. Press
Done to save your changes.

Known Bugs
----------

Preset application paths are not implemented for macOS, so Mac users will need
to define the path to the browser executable manually for now.

Note
----

This extension is not created by, affiliated with, or endorsed by LastPass,
Mozilla, or the SeaMonkey or Pale Moon projects.
